# Workflow Directory

This repository contains user-submitted workflows for [Workflow for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l64N).

All workflows are saved as **.wflow** files and located in the **workflows/** directory so that they are available without needing a **workflow.is** link. Each workflow includes a README with information about it.
